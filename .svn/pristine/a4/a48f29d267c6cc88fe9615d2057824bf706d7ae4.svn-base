                                In case of any technical issue due to which the payment gets deducted from the payer’s account and does not show in our official ERP but the payment gateway service clearly mentions the confirmed settlement thereafter the College’s account receives the payment. We manually submit the payment in our ERP. It should take 7-10 working days for the payment to be credited in College’s account.

                                If double payment happens and the payment gateway service clearly mentions it, the College will refund the payment after the College’s account receives payment. Which should take 7-10 working days for the back payment or we can adjust the amount to the next month fee as per Payers request.
